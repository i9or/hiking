# Time to do some sketchy shit

Do da! Do da!

Hope, I'll get away with it:

- [ ] Router with async/await
- [ ] Bare SQL queries to the DB via template literals (+migrations)
- [ ] HTML templating with template literals as well (+helpers)
- [ ] Basic/token authentication
- [ ] Scaffolding + CLI
- [ ] TypeScript everywhere
- [ ] Automatic reload?
- [ ] Oh, da do da day!
